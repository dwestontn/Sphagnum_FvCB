# Sphagnum_FvCB
A very basic plant photosynthesis model being tuned for Sphangum

The goal of this project is to use a basic plant photosynthesis model (FvCB) as part of a biomass production estimate (GPP/NPP) through a season long peatland experiment. LiCOR 8100 clear top chambers were used throughout the season to estimate CO2 gas exchange on S. magellanicum and S. fallax within each chamber (some 30 cm diameter??). additional estimates include total N, N fixation, microbiome, production.

Analysis plan:
1. Explore the 8100 seasonal data
2. Get GPP from 8100 data and estimates from production (Rich Norby)
3. See if model simulations can explain seasonal patterns of GPP
4. Does the bog N budget support the production estimates/measurements
5. Insights into cool model guided research (the next study)
